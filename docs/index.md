**DIGITS is an on-going initiative to facilitate interdisciplinary analysis on large-scale groundwater sustainability topics through providing an open-access database containing preprocessed, analysis-ready global data curated from the existing scientific and grey literature.**

Navigate through the tabs on the left to access data, documentation, and provide feedback on this initiative.

SEGMENTS is maintained by Xander Huggins (<xanderhuggins@uvic.ca>), Tom Gleeson (<tgleeson@uvic.ca>), and James S. Famiglietti (<jay.famiglietti@usask.ca>). For more information see the open-access paper:
