DIGITS is an on-going initiative to facilitate interdisciplinary analysis on large-scale groundwater sustainability topics through providing an open-access database containing preprocessed, analysis-ready global data curated from the existing scientific and grey literature.

Navigate through the tabs on the left to access data, documentation, and provide feedback on this initiative.

SEGMENTS is maintained by Xander Huggins (<xanderhuggins@uvic.ca>), Tom Gleeson (<tgleeson@uvic.ca>), and James S. Famiglietti (<jay.famiglietti@usask.ca>). For more information see the open-access paper:

Huggins, X., Gleeson, T., J.S. Famiglietti. Data science for global social-ecological systems: a new approach for wicked groundwater sustainability challenges. *Manuscript currently in preparation*.
