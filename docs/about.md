### About

SEGMENTS is an ongoing initiative to facilitate interdisciplinary analysis on large-scale groundwater sustainability topics through providing an open-access database containing pre-harmonized, global data curated from the existing scientific and grey literature.

SEGMENTS is maintained by Xander Huggins (<xanderhuggins@uvic.ca>), Tom Gleeson (<tgleeson@uvic.ca>), and James S. Famiglietti (<jay.famiglietti@usask.ca>). For more information see the open-access paper:

Huggins, X., Gleeson, T., J.S. Famiglietti. (in preparation). Data science for global social-ecological systems: a new approach for wicked groundwater sustainability challenges. *to be submitted to PLoS ONE.*
